                            a suite of workloads for characterizing performance
                            of Java EE Application Servers. The workloads
                            consist of an end to end web application and a full
                            set of primitives. The applications are a collection
                            of Java classes, Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages,
                            and Enterprise Java Beans built to open Java EE
                            APIs. Together these provide versatile and portable
                            test cases designed to measure aspects of
                            scalability and performance.

                            DayTrader is an end-to-end benchmark and performance
                            sample application. It provides a real world Java EE
                            workload.<br />
                            <br />
                            DayTrader's new design spans Java EE 7, including
                            the new WebSockets specification. Other Java EE
                            features include JSPs, Servlets, EJBs, JPA, JDBC,
                            JMS, MDBs, and transactions (synchronous and
                            asynchronous/2-phase commit).<br />

                            leverage the DayTrader application infrastructure to
                            test specific Java EE components such as the servlet
